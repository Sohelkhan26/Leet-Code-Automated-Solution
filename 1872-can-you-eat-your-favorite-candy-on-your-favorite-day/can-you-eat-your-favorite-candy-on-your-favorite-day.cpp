/*
candiesCount[i] of candy of i'th type
to eat i'th type candy, all [0..i - 1]th type candy should be eaten.

query limit applies to any day

i'th type candy d'th favorite day
i'th type candy should remain at least 1
all i - 1th type eaten
at least 'd' candy eaten
can't cross daily limit. 

before fav day, fav candy eaten, possible when? d > pref[i] - 1 even eating 1 candy per day will exhaust fav candy
pref[i - 1] candy should be eaten in the first d - 1 day
without breaking limit. if limit breaks return false????


TL; DR:
Two possibility for false:
1. Favourite candy depleted before favorite day. When?
Even after eating 1 candy per day, we can't make it until fav day
i.e : day > pref[i] - 1
2. To eat favorite candy at all, we have to eat all (i - 1) candies without breaking the limit. All i - 1 candy = pref[i - 1]
To eat this much candy we need at least this limit = pref[i - 1] / day
