/*
In every string in words, some characters can be inserted so that size of the group with same character is at least 3.
So, for every character group we have to check if it's count is less than or equal to corresponding group in s(if the group size is greater than 3).
If the group size is less than 3, then group in s and words[i] should be of same count.
