/*
Am i overcomplicating things or this problem is harder than most?
bidirectional pairs are not always possible.
abc -> ba but not ba -> abc
But sssll -> lls and lls -> sssll
How to distinguish between the two?
I think Trie is needed. Or hashing?
And to make things even more complicated input can contains empty strings.
As if things were not complicated enough.
abcd -> dcba 
dcba -> abcd
