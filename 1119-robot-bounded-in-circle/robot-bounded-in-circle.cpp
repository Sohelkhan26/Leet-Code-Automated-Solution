/*
Such an amazing problem. But rating is quite low. 
Think of G..G as vector , and L/R as changing the direction of the vector.
If the vector change direction once, Because of never-ending sequence of instructions, the vector will meet at it's starting index.
Simulate for something simple like : GGR
complex instruction GGRGGLGGLGG will only complicate the shape of the area created by vector. But it will get back at start
