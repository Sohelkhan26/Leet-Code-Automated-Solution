/*
what if some houses are sold for i'th buyer want to buy? If any house is previously sold, we can't sell it to i'th buyer.
seems like a DP problem take/notTake/knapsack 
if we choose the i'th buyer out to choose the next buyer? ensuring 
their intended house don't clash? could do a linear search
storing the interval and manually check all. Or we can do binary search to find 
next earliest non-overlapping interval.
